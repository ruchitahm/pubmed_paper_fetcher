# üìù  PubMed Paper Fetcher: Project Report 

## 1. Introduction 
The PubMed Paper Fetcher  is a Python-based command-line tool designed to retrieve research papers from PubMed based on a user-specified query. The tool filters results to identify papers with at least one author affiliated with a  pharmaceutical or biotech company  and saves the results in a CSV file.

##  2. Approach & Methodology 

###  2.1. Approach 
The approach to building this project consisted of the following key steps:
1.  Understanding the requirements  - Analyzing the problem statement and determining the features.
2.  Fetching data from PubMed API  - Using the  Entrez eSearch and eSummary APIs  to retrieve research papers.
3.  Filtering relevant data  - Identifying non-academic authors and extracting company affiliations.
4.  Saving results  - Storing extracted information in a CSV file with appropriate formatting.
5.  Building a command-line interface (CLI)  - Enabling user interaction with the tool.
6.  Testing & validation  - Ensuring correctness and robustness of the script.

###  2.2. Methodology 

####  Step 1: Fetching Papers from PubMed 
- Used  Requests library  to send API requests to PubMed.
- Implemented PubMed's  query syntax support  to allow flexible searches.
- Retrieved research paper IDs using `esearch.fcgi`.

####  Step 2: Extracting Paper Details 
- Retrieved detailed paper information via `esummary.fcgi`.
- Extracted key details:  PubmedID, Title, Publication Date, Authors, and Affiliations. 

####  Step 3: Identifying Non-Academic Authors 
- Implemented a heuristic approach to filter  non-academic affiliations .
- Used keywords like  "university", "hospital", "institute"  to classify academic vs. non-academic authors.

####  Step 4: Extracting Corresponding Author Email 
- Used  regular expressions (regex)  to extract emails from the abstract text.
- If no email was found, returned "Not Available".

####  Step 5: Saving Results in CSV 
- Used  Pandas  to store extracted data.
- Saved the results in `pubmed_papers.csv` (or a user-specified filename via `-f` option).

####  Step 6: Implementing a Command-Line Interface 
- Used  Click  to build an intuitive CLI with options:
  - `-h` or `--help` ‚Üí Display usage instructions.
  - `-d` or `--debug` ‚Üí Print debug information.
  - `-f <filename>` ‚Üí Save results to a custom file.

####  Step 7: Testing & Validation 
-  Tested different queries  to ensure correct filtering and CSV output.
-  Handled edge cases  (e.g., no results, network failures, empty queries).
-  Debug mode (`-d`)  was added for troubleshooting.
